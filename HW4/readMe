I added "quit" and "Quit" command to be able to end game instantaneously.
When you write it number of cells fulled writed at the end of static string which is named as numbers_of_nonEmpty_cells.
index of the number of fulled cells in the specific board will be reached by help of index_of_game variable which is also private and int.
When user wants to see number of filled cells,index_of_gameTH element of string will contain it. 
For example:
	if you have filled 10 cells and you wrote quit command :
		string will be = "10 "
		and index of 10 (0) is kept in the class' index_of_game variable
	when you started second game and one of the player wins and 30 cells are full then our string will be = "10 30 "
	and index of 30 (1) is kept in the class' index_of_game variable
when you compare these two games we will reach them with the help of index_of_game variable


Copy constructer && assignment operator overload:
	They will help us to keep playing copied game if it has not ended yet. If it has ended , then program will show a message such that: "Copied game has already ended See you next time"
	
	In main I wrote them such that they will work automaticly , so after the game ends if it tries to make you continue from where were you last, do not be suprised. If you delete copy constructer and delete constructer , games will come by one by one.

After making undo or loading a file one of the scores is wrong. After making 1 move it shows the true score hopefully.
