I added "quit" and "Quit" command to be able to end game instantaneously.
When you write it number of cells fulled writed at the end of static string which is named as numbers_of_nonEmpty_cells.
index of the number of fulled cells in the specific board will be reached by help of index_of_game variable which is also private and int.
When user wants to see number of filled cells,index_of_gameTH element of string will contain it. 
For example:
	if you have filled 10 cells and you wrote quit command :
		string will be = "10 "
		and index of 10 (0) is kept in the class' index_of_game variable
	when you started second game and one of the player wins and 30 cells are full then our string will be = "10 30 "
	and index of 30 (1) is kept in the class' index_of_game variable
when you compare these two games we will reach them with the help of index_of_game variable
